# Coding Rules (Pointer)

This project's coding rules live in `CODING_RULES.md` in the project root. They are
BINDING for all code work in this repository.

MANDATORY: Before writing or editing ANY code, you MUST Read `CODING_RULES.md`
in full **in the current session**. Do not rely on memory of a previous session,
a summary, or partial reads.

If you are about to make a code change and have not read `CODING_RULES.md` in
this session: STOP, read it, then continue.

Do not inline rules back into this file and do not use `@import` for
`CODING_RULES.md` — it is intentionally referenced, not imported.

## Code Analysis

Two analysis modes — pick by situation:

**Changed-files run (default after implementing a feature, finishing a plan, or
fixing a bug):**

```bash
powershell -Command "cd 'D:\GIT\BenjaminKobjolke\git-repo-status-check'; cmd /c '.\tools\analyze_changed_and_new_files.bat'"
```

Uses `--only-changed`: the report is filtered to files new/modified vs git `HEAD`
(includes untracked). Project-wide analyzers still run; only the report is
filtered. Fast feedback, no noise from pre-existing violations elsewhere.

**Full run (whole-project audits):**

```bash
powershell -Command "cd 'D:\GIT\BenjaminKobjolke\git-repo-status-check'; cmd /c '.\tools\analyze_code.bat'"
```

Use the full run for: an explicit audit request (`/analyze:run-and-fix`),
exception maintenance (`/analyze:improve-exceptions`), before a release/merge,
after refactors that touch shared code, or when the working tree is clean vs
`HEAD` (a changed-files run would report nothing).

Results are written to `code_analysis_results/` as **per-rule CSV files** (e.g.
`line_count_report.csv`, `ruff_report.csv`, `duplicate_code.csv`) — there is
no `.md` report, and a missing CSV means that rule found nothing. Fix any
reported issues before committing.
