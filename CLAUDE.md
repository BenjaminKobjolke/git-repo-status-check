# Coding Rules (Pointer)

This project's rules live in two files in the project root:

- `CODING_RULES.md` — code quality and conventions. BINDING for all code work in
  this repository, always.
- `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md` — the end-to-end flow to follow when planning and
  implementing a change (checks, gates, Definition of Done).

MANDATORY: Before writing or editing ANY code, you MUST Read BOTH files in full
**in the current session**. Do not rely on memory of a previous session, a
summary, or partial reads.

If you are about to make a code change and have not read both files in this
session: STOP, read them, then continue.

An external tool may orchestrate the implementation itself. When a skill or run
states that the implementation is orchestrated, ignore `IMPLEMENTATION_FLOW.md`
entirely — the orchestrator runs those steps as its own phases. `CODING_RULES.md`
stays binding either way.

Do not inline rules back into this file and do not use `@import` for either file —
they are intentionally referenced, not imported.


## Code Analysis

Two analysis modes — pick by situation:

**Changed-files run (default after implementing a feature, finishing a plan, or
fixing a bug):**

```bash
powershell -Command "cd 'D:\GIT\BenjaminKobjolke\git-repo-status-check'; cmd /c '.\tools\analyze_changed_and_new_files.bat'"
```

Uses `--only-changed`: the report is filtered to files new/modified vs git `HEAD`
(includes untracked). Project-wide analyzers still run; only the report is
filtered. Fast feedback, no noise from pre-existing violations elsewhere.

**Full run (whole-project audits):**

```bash
powershell -Command "cd 'D:\GIT\BenjaminKobjolke\git-repo-status-check'; cmd /c '.\tools\analyze_code.bat'"
```

Use the full run for: an explicit audit request (`/analyze:run-and-fix`),
exception maintenance (`/analyze:improve-exceptions`), before a release/merge,
after refactors that touch shared code, or when the working tree is clean vs
`HEAD` (a changed-files run would report nothing).

Results are written to `code_analysis_results/` as **per-rule CSV files** (e.g.
`line_count_report.csv`, `ruff_report.csv`, `duplicate_code.csv`) — there is
no `.md` report, and a missing CSV means that rule found nothing. Fix any
reported issues before committing.

# graphify

This project's graphify scan root is `src/` (see the graphify block in `CODING_RULES.md`).
Rebuild with `/graphify src/ --directed` from the repo root, never the repo root itself.
